VS Code v0.00.0

### Changed

## [4.0.1](https://github.com/cdr/code-server/releases/tag/v4.0.1) - 2022-01-04

VS Code v1.63.0

code-server has been rebased on upstream's newly open-sourced server
implementation (#4414).

### Changed

- Web socket compression has been made the default (when supported). This means
  the `--enable` flag will no longer take `permessage-deflate` as an option.
- The static endpoint can no longer reach outside code-server. However the
  vscode-remote-resource endpoint still can.
- OpenVSX has been made the default marketplace.
- The last opened folder/workspace is no longer stored separately in the
  settings file (we rely on the already-existing query object instead).
- The marketplace override environment variables `SERVICE_URL` and `ITEM_URL`
  have been replaced with a single `EXTENSIONS_GALLERY` variable that
  corresponds to `extensionsGallery` in VS Code's `product.json`.

### Added

- `VSCODE_PROXY_URI` env var for use in the terminal and extensions.

### Removed

- Extra extension directories have been removed. The `--extra-extensions-dir`
  and `--extra-builtin-extensions-dir` flags will no longer be accepted.
- The `--install-source` flag has been removed.

### Deprecated

- `--link` is now deprecated (#4562).

### Security

- We fixed a XSS vulnerability by escaping HTML from messages in the error page (#4430).

VS Code v1.56.0

### Changed

- Update to VS Code 1.56.0 (#3269).
- Minor connections refactor (#3178). Improves connection stability.
- Use ptyHostService (#3308). This brings us closer to upstream VS Code.

### Added

- Add flag for toggling permessage-deflate (#3286). The default is off so
  compression will no longer be used by default. Use the --enable flag to
  toggle it back on.

### Fixed

- Make rate limiter not count against successful logins (#3141).
- Refactor logout (#3277). This fixes logging out in some scenarios.
